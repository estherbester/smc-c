Write a complete C program that prompts the user for test Value.  TestValue should be a positive number  between 0 to 100.

Your main function should call or activate function name getGrade and Pass the testValue as its argument. The getGrade should return a letter grade use (if  average >= 90, A, >=80, B etc.). to compute a grade.

Do not forget comments

int main()
{
   double testValue;

  …

 printf(“your grade is %c\n”, getGrade(testValue));

 Return 0;
}
